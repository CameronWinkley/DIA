<p><h2>ABOUT DANCE IMAGE ACADEMY</h2>
Thank you for your interest in DIA (Dance Image Academy).  We know there are many choices out there when it comes to 
dance lessons and we think you will be very happy with what we have to offer. 
 We have some of the best prices in the valley, a wonderful new studio space, 
 awesome qualified teachers, unique & fun routines, music, costumes, and amazing dancers!  
 We are able to teach our students to be competitive- while maintaining a family like atmosphere at the studio.  
 While dance is all about learning the proper technique, form, and skills; 
 it also is about having FUN and learning to be passionate about it.  
 One of the best things about dance is being able to express yourself through it…and we believe you can do that whether you have 
 been dancing for 10 years or this is your first year, whether you are a graceful ballerina or getting funky in hip hop, whether 
 you are 2 years old or 99, and whether you are a girl or a boy.  That is why we offer so many different class options and styles,
  in competitive teams and training classes.  DIA is consistently recognized for its unique style and team unity, 
winning many “Judges Choice”, “Overall” awards, and “Best Sportsmanship & Spirit” at competitions. </p>
